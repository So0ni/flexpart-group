The option \"-c key1:[i|d|s|n],key2:[i|d|s|n],... \" can be used to 
compare a set of keys or namespaces. The letter after the colon is optional and it is used to force the
type used in the comparison which is otherwise assumed to be the native type of the key.

 - :i ->  integer
 - :d ->  floating-point  (C type double)
 - :s ->  string
 - :n ->  namespace.

When the type \"n\" is used all the set of keys belonging to the specified namespace
