NAME	codes_split_file
	
DESCRIPTION

	Split an input file (GRIB, BUFR etc) into chunks of roughly the same size. The output files are named input_01, input_02 etc. This is much faster than grib_copy/bufr_copy.
	If the nchunks argument is -1, then the file is split into the individual messages.

USAGE
	codes_split_file [-v] nchunks input

OPTIONS
	-v  Print the count of messages and files created
